#  Angularjs ~ And everything Else &nbsp;[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/iRunner/Angularjs-seed.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/iRunner/Angularjs-seed)

I find front end web development to be super open and everyone has their own
best practices. This is great ~ and so I came up with my own template based off
of the tutorials below. 

This template takes more of a "Fuck it. Ship it." approach to web development.
After developing, everything is compressed to a single js file, with another js
file of dependences. There is one css that is built off of multiple sass files.
and all the templates are built in one location, while the index is still at
root ~ 

I'm not sure how this will fair in larger scale projects ~ but grunt is easy
enough to play around with~ 

## Angular Shell

Grunt is love. Grunt is life. 

## Auto include bower file
[Bower Shell](http://fuseinteractive.ca/blog/automating-bower-library-integration-grunt#.VOv8s1PF8m8)

Bower is cool, but linking is annoying ~ 

## SASS 

[SASS](http://sass-lang.com/guide)
[SASS + Grunt](http://ryanchristiani.com/getting-started-with-grunt-and-sass/)

Have SASS extend your bootstrap ~ sadly still have to use the `@include` function in SASS to include it ~
