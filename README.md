#  Angularjs ~ And everything Else

## Angular Shell
[Shell](http://manuel.kiessling.net/2014/06/09/creating-a-useful-angularjs-project-structure-and-toolchain/)

Grunt is love. Grunt is life. 

## Auto include bower file
[Bower Shell](http://fuseinteractive.ca/blog/automating-bower-library-integration-grunt#.VOv8s1PF8m8)
[Bower_Concat](https://github.com/sapegin/grunt-bower-concat)

Bower is cool, but linking is annoying ~ 

## SASS 

[SASS](http://sass-lang.com/guide)
[SASS + Grunt](http://ryanchristiani.com/getting-started-with-grunt-and-sass/)

Have SASS extend your bootstrap ~ sadly still have to use the `@include` function in SASS to include it ~
